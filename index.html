        <p>Hi! My name is Anton. I have been working as a Web Developer for over than 10 years. It is very interesting to go back and remember the basics of the HTML üòÅ</p>

        <br>
        <strong>My favorite Bible quote: Matthew 6:28-34</strong>
        <p>
            28 ‚ÄúAnd why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you‚Äîyou of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‚ÄòWhat shall we eat?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we drink?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we wear?‚Äô 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

        <p>Tbilisi is the capital of the country of Georgia. Its cobblestoned old town reflects a long, complicated history, with periods under Persian and Russian rule. Its diverse architecture encompasses Eastern Orthodox churches, ornate art nouveau buildings and Soviet Modernist structures.</p>
